# Agro-food_CO2_emission
About Dataset

The agricultural CO2 emission dataset has been constructed by merging and reprocessing approximately a dozen individual datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and data from IPCC. These datasets were, cleaned, preprocessed and merged together to create a comprehensive and cohesive dataset for analysis and forecasting purposes.

The dataset, as demonstrated in the notebook, describes CO2 emissions related to agri-food, which amount to approximately 62% of the global annual emissions.

Indeed, the emissions from the agri-food sector are significant when studying climate change. As the dataset shows, these emissions contribute to a substantial portion of the global annual emissions. Understanding and addressing the environmental impact of the agri-food industry is crucial for mitigating climate change and developing sustainable practices within this sector.

For a better understanding of the dataset, I have written a notebook where I perform an analysis of the relationship between emissions, climate change and geografic Area. Additionally, I provide an example of regression to predict the percentage variations in temperatures.

Importance and Context:

The agricultural sector contributes to approximately, how i'll demostrate in my notebook, 62% of the total global CO2 emissions, making it a significant contributor to climate change. This dataset plays a crucial role in understanding and monitoring the impact of agricultural activities on CO2 emissions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, it enables the forecasting of future emissions, allowing policymakers and researchers to develop targeted strategies and interventions for sustainable agricultural practices. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for climate scientists, environmental researchers, and policymakers striving to mitigate the environmental impact of the agricultural sector.
Author note:

    CO2 is recorded in kilotons (kt): 1 kt represents 1000 kg of CO2.
    The feature "Average Temperature C째", which can be used as the target for machine learning models, represents the average yearly temperature increase. For example, if it is 0.12, it means that the temperature in that specific location increased by 0.12 degrees Celsius.
    Forestland is the only feature that exhibits negative emissions due to its role as a carbon sink. Through photosynthesis, forests absorb and store carbon dioxide, effectively removing it from the atmosphere. Sustainable forest management, along with afforestation and reforestation efforts, further contribute to negative emissions by increasing carbon sequestration capacity.
    If you prefer Fahrenheit to Celsius, here is the formula: 째F = (째C x 9/5) + 32
